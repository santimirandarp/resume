Work Experience and Contributions
--------------------

2021-2022
:   Github Open Source Contributor 

    Contributor to chemistry projects written in Typescript, Javascript or Python. I've written code for [parsing NMR data](https://github.com/santimirandarp/varian-converter) (Varian/Agilent) as well as [Raman data](https://github.com/santimirandarp/wdf-parser). In these cases, the code converts the original source files (binary and text) to a friendly JSON format that is general, easy to transfer and understood by any web browser.

2020-2022
:   Developer Hubs 
   Active member of the [MongoDB Developers Forum](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/u/santimir/summary) as well as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12582392/minsky) and other networks. 

2017-2019
:   Chemistry Lecturer
    Introduction to Chemistry Lecturer at "Instituto Superior de Formación Docente Nº3" (Higher Institute of Teacher Training Nº3), Argentina. The role consisted on teaching students (between 20 and 30 years old) aspiring to become High School teachers. The role classroom lectures as well preparing simple laboratory experiences (destilation, calorimetry, titrations).


Education
---------

2015-2017
:  MSc in Physical Chemistry at University of La Plata, Argentina.<p></p>
  **Thesis**: _Computational calculation of thermodynamical properties for chemical reactions in condensed phase_.<p></p>
  The thesis consisted in putting together chemistry packages used for conformer generation, solvent effect simulation, semiempirical quantum calculations and statistical calculations. The program was written in Python.<p></p>
  The thesis was developed at the Centre For Inorganic Chemistry and supervised by Martin Lavecchia <lavecchia@gmail.com> and Carlos Franca.

2012-2015
: Chemistry Degree at University of La Plata, Argentina.
  This course included (but was not restricted to) General Chemistry, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, Spectroscopy Techniques (Mass Spectroscopy, IR, UV/Vis, Raman), Biology, Algebra, Calculus, Statistics.


Other interests
------------------------

Gap Year
:   During 2019-2021 I volunteer at farms, hostels, and other places while travelling and learning to
code as well as some Greek and Italian. This was very rewarding experience. During that time I [coded a blog](https://misterybodon.github.io/web/).

Mind and Body
:   Climbing, hiking, camping and outdoor activities help me to stay healthy and happy.
:   I practice Zen meditation and have volunteer for a few Buddhist Centres in Italy (Thabarwa) and England (Kadampa).

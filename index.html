<dd><p>Github Open Source Contributor</p>
<p>Contributor to chemistry projects written in Typescript, Javascript or Python. I’ve written code for <a href="https://github.com/santimirandarp/varian-converter">parsing NMR data</a> (Varian/Agilent) as well as <a href="https://github.com/santimirandarp/wdf-parser">Raman data</a>. In these cases, the code converts the original source files (binary and text) to a friendly JSON format that is general, easy to transfer and understood by any web browser.</p>
